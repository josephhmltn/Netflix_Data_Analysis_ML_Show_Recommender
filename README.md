## Predictive Modeling: Recommendation System 🤖

### System Setup and Methodology 🛠️

#### Feature Extraction and Similarity Measure
- **Combined Features**: Merged 'genre' and 'description' into one text feature.
- **TF-IDF**: Transformed text data into numerical format for machine learning.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computed similarity scores between titles.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Data Preparation
netflix_data_cleaned['combined_features'] = netflix_data_cleaned['genre'].str.cat(netflix_data_cleaned['description'], sep=" ")

# TF-IDF Vectorization
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(netflix_data_cleaned['combined_features'].fillna(''))

# Cosine Similarity Matrix
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

# Building function to output recommendation titles and their associated index number
def recommend_titles_modified(title, cosine_sim=cosine_sim, df=netflix_data_cleaned, indices=indices):
    # Get the index of the movie
    idx = indices[title].iloc[0]
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx]))
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    movie_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores[1:11]]
    return df['title'].iloc[movie_indices]
```
### Recommendation Function
- **Functionality**: Recommends similar titles based on input title.
- **Usage**: Finds the title's index, calculates similarity scores, and sorts similar titles.

### Function Testing and Validation 🔍
- **Functionality**: Tested with titles like "Breaking Bad", "Brooklyn Nine-Nine", and "Mindhunter".
- **Output**: Successfully generated lists of similar titles.
